<h1>Why not

<p>This chapter explores the idea of immortality, and it explores if immortality is actually as good as it sounds. This may not be a moral question anymore but in the future this might be something that people struggle through. One article by Johnty Andersen explores the price of immortality.</p>

<p>Eventually being immortal will be like any other medical treatment, but it would probably be a lot more expensive. It is projected that we will achieve biological immortality in the next 15-25 years.  The price of immortality will go down the more people use this technology. That is the best case scenario, I believe that the ability to become immoral will  only be given to the rich and famous. People with influence will be given the power to life forever while the common folk are left to die.</p>

<p>How is immortality going to be achieved? The are many ways that scientist believe that will lead to human immortality. The one that will most likely happen is uploading your conscience. In the future people will not be confined to reality but we will create our own realities in the virtual world. The hardware required to achieve something like this is not far away. Scientist estimate that the human brain can store about 2.5 petabytes (that is, 2,500 terabytes) worth of information. In 2014 scientist were able to simulate a wormâ€™s brain and put it into a robot. It is only a matter of time before we are able to upload our brains into a computer to be recalled later. Humans can be god of their own personal universe the possibilities in this virtual world are endless. Virtual Reality has become more than just science fiction, it is now a popular video game genre. Players from around the globe are able to interact with each other in a world of human creation. Gaming companies are creating machines that will help the user input their physical body into the virtual world.</p>

<p>Before we are able to make our physical bodies immortal we are going to have immortal minds that live inside a computer ready to be recalled. Another possibility with uploading your mind is that if your body dies then you can just download your brain into a different body. It would be interesting if in this future there were companies that made body replacements. In case you die or if you just want to look like someone else you could just order a new body.</p>

<p>To end this off, There are many ways that humans can achieve immortality but I believe that we will be able to upload our minds into machines before we are able to use gene therapy. After we solve the problem of mortality we have to ask ourselves, Is it moral to live forever? Is being immortal as good as it sounds?</p>
